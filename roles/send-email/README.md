How to use send-email roles

#EXAMPLE

  ansible-playbook notification_email.yml -e "se_subject='Message subject' se_message='<b>Simple HTML message</b>' se_to='Mr. James Bond <james.bond@example.cz>' se_temp_type='docker_update_available' env='PRODUCTION'" --ask-vault-pass

You are supposed to play notification_email.yml playbook in the role folder. The extra vars are:
  - se_subject='Subject of the message'
  - se_message='<b>Simple content of a message in HTML format</b>'
  - se_to='Mr. James Bond <james.bond@example.cz>'
  - se_temp_type='name of one of the available templates (see TIPS and TRICK below)'
  - se_version='one of the variable used in templates'

#TIPS and TRICKS
  1) When you play the playbook it gives you list of available templates
  2) the --ask-vault-pass can be replaced by -â€“vault-password-file path_to_the_file and you don't need to state the password for encryption anymore.  

#DEFAULTS
In folder defaults are listed and defined all used variable except those used in templates. Those ones must be defined only in extra vars to be notified when their definition is missing

#TASKS
  checks.yml
    Consists of few vital checks for the role like templates availability.
  main.yml
    Two tasks insert choosen template or message from extra vars to the main template which is to be sent  .

#TEMPLATES
  main.html
    Is an empty file acting as temporary template holder before sending it out.
  all_other_templates.html
    Created HTML files used as a templates for emails. to use one of them you have to state its name without sufix in extra vars.

#VARS
  main.yml
    Encrypted by ansible-vaul. Password to the ansible vault is in AURA's Bitwarden.
    Consists of configuration settings and credentials. Test
